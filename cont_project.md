## Repository
[(https://github.com/Evalerian009/loop.git)]

---

## Stack & Setup
- **Frontend**: Next.js 13 (App Router), React (functional components, hooks)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (credentials/email-based)
- **Realtime messaging**: Socket.IO (WebSocket) + Prisma for persistence
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

---

## Completed Milestones

### Milestone 1: Project Setup
- Next.js + TypeScript configured
- Prisma ORM set up with PostgreSQL
- NextAuth.js implemented for authentication
- Prisma models created for `User`, `Channel`, `Message`, and `ChannelMember`
- `.env.local` configured with `DATABASE_URL` and NextAuth secrets

### Milestone 2: Authentication
- User registration and login using NextAuth.js
- Passwords stored in DB
- Auth-protected routes using `getServerSession`
- Redirects for unauthenticated users implemented

### Milestone 3: Channels
- General channel seeded via Prisma
- API routes for fetching user channels (`/api/channels/user`)
- Client displays channels in sidebar, auto-selects General if none specified

### Milestone 4: Messaging
- API routes implemented:
  - `/api/messages` (POST) – send message
  - `/api/messages/[channelId]` (GET) – fetch messages
- Client component for channel page:
  - Shows messages per channel
  - Allows sending new messages
  - Optimistic updates implemented for smooth UX
  - Auto-scroll to newest messages

### Milestone 5: Real-Time Messaging
- WebSocket setup using Socket.IO
- Users join rooms for channels
- Messages broadcast to channel members in real-time
- Client updated to use WebSocket for new messages (polling removed)
- Optimistic updates maintained alongside WebSocket events

---

## Known Notes / Considerations
- Current WebSocket implementation is server-side via `app/api/socket/route.ts`
- Prisma seeding handles General channel creation and can seed a test user
- Optimistic updates on client are in place to improve UX for sending messages
- Channel membership stored via `ChannelMember` relation table
- No message deletion, editing, or reactions yet
- Error handling mostly basic; can be improved
- Frontend uses simple Tailwind styling; layout is a sidebar + chat area

---

## Next Steps (Suggestions)
- Implement message deletion and editing
- Add user avatars
- Improve error handling for network/DB errors
- Improve UI/UX for channel list and chat
- Consider typing indicators, online status, or read receipts
- Add tests for API routes and WebSocket events

## Helpful File Paths
- `app/api/messages/route.ts` – sending messages
- `app/api/messages/[channelId]/route.ts` – fetching messages
- `app/api/channels/user/route.ts` – fetching channels for user
- `app/api/socket/route.ts` – WebSocket setup
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` – dashboard after login
- `app/channels/[id]/page.tsx` – channel chat page
- `lib/prisma.ts` – Prisma client setup
